## Algorithms and data structures

---

Contains algorithms examples and exercises of data structures.

Here you can find algorithms that I tried to implement, as well, some rudimentary implementations
of data structures on the `TypeScript` language.

Well, is something to help me learn, understand and practice with problems related to performance.

### How to run this algorithms (if you want to)

I have decided to use [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the runtime, because it is easy to setup and use.

#### Concepts

- BIG O notation
- Performances of a algorithm
  - Runtime Cost
  - Memory Cost
- How it works
  - Arrays
  - Objects
  - HashMaps
